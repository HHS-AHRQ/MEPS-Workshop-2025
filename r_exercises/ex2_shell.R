# This program shows how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions file 
# to the Office-based medical visits file for data year 2023 to estimate:
#   - Total number of people w/ office-based visit for cancer
#   - Total number of office visits for cancer
#   - Total expenditures on office visits for cancer 
#   - Percent of people with an office visit for cancer
#   - Average per-person expense for office visits for cancer
#
# Input files:
#   - h248g.dta        (2023 Office-based medical visits file)
#   - h249.dta         (2023 Conditions file)
#   - h248if1.dta      (2023 CLNK: Condition-Event Link file)
#   - h251.dta         (2023 Full-Year Consolidated file)

# Install/load packages and set global options --------------------------------

# Can skip this part if already installed

# install.packages("survey")    # for survey analysis
# install.packages("haven")     # for loading Stata (.dta) files
# install.packages("tidyverse") # for data manipulation


# Load libraries (run this part each time you restart R)




# Set survey option for lonely PSUs

 
  

# Load datasets ---------------------------------------------------------------
  
#  OB   = Office-based medical visits file (record = medical visit)
#  COND = Medical conditions file (record = medical condition)
#  CLNK = Conditions-event link file (crosswalk between conditions and 
#             events, including PMED events)
#  FYC  = Full-year-consolidated file (record = MEPS sample person)
  

# Load Stata data files using read_dta from the haven package 





# Keep only needed variables ------------------------------------------------

#  Browse variables using MEPS-HC data tools variable explorer:

# Prepare data for estimation -------------------------------------------------

# Subset condition records to CANCER (any CCSR = "NEO...") 
#  + FAC006 (Encounters for antineoplastic therapies)
#  - NEO073 (Benign neoplasms)







# view ICD10-CCSR combinations for cancer






# >> Note that the same person can have multiple cancers, and can even have 
# multiple conditions with the same ICD10CDX and CCSR values

# >> Example (DUPERSID == '2790405102')




# Merge cancer conditions with OB event file, using CLNK as crosswalk
#  >> use multiple = "all" option for many-to-many merge





# QC: check that EVENTYPE = 1 (OB) for all rows in cancer_merged





# >> Example of same event (EVNTIDX) for treating multiple cancers for same
# person (DUPERSID == '2790405102')
     


     
# De-duplicate on EVNTIDX so we don't count the same event twice
     




# >> Check example person (DUPERSID == '2790405102'):

 


# Aggregate to person-level --------------------------------------------------
     



  
# Add person-level indicator variable
     



# Revisiting our example case at the person level (DUPERSID == '2790405102')




# Merge onto FYC file ---------------------------------------------------------
#  >> Need to capture all Strata (VARSTR) and PSUs (VARPSU) for all MEPS sample 
#     persons for correct variance estimation





# QC: should have same number of rows as FYC file
