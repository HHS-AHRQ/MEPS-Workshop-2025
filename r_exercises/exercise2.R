# This program shows how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions file 
# to the Office-based medical visits file for data year 2023 to estimate:
#   - Total number of people w/ office-based visit for cancer
#   - Total number of office visits for cancer
#   - Total expenditures on office visits for cancer 
#   - Percent of people with an office visit for cancer
#   - Average per-person expense for office visits for cancer
#
# Input files:
#   - h248g.dta        (2023 Office-based medical visits file)
#   - h249.dta         (2023 Conditions file)
#   - h248if1.dta      (2023 CLNK: Condition-Event Link file)
#   - h251.dta         (2023 Full-Year Consolidated file)
