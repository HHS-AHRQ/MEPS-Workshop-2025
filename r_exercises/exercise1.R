# This program generates the following estimates for national health care for 
# the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population, 2023:
#  - Overall expenses (National totals)
#  - Percentage of persons with an expense
#  - Mean expense per person
#  - Mean/median expense per person with an expense:
#    - Mean expense per person with an expense
#    - Mean expense per person with an expense, by age group
#    - Median expense per person with an expense, by age group
#
# Input file:
#  - C:/MEPS/h251.dta (2023 Full-year file - Stata format)
